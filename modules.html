      <h2>3D FUNDAMENTALS</h2>
      <p>This module introduces students to basic digital 3D production workflow to create assets for interactive projects. Students will practice basic modelling, UV unwrapping, digital sculpting, high-poly detail onto low-poly mapping, texturing, rigging, animation, real-time lighting and rendering. Students will learn to produce hard-surface virtual objects for real-time engine.</p>
