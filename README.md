# EduHub

EduHub is a one-stop app for students of Ngee Ann Poly that merges the features of NPal, Brightspace and NPGO. We think that it is a hassle for students to juggle between these three apps during their poly life. For example, students usually have to have these three apps open to check their timetable (NPal), take attendance (NPGO) and access module materials (Brightspace). Hence, EduHub serves as a culmination of the features of these three apps to help students navigate their poly life seamlessly. Gone are the days where students have to open multiple tabs just to go about their day!

Furthermore, EduHub also features a points system and a redeem store to incentivise students to use the app!

## Design Process

As mentioned above, the primary goal of EduHub was to make a one-stop app that merges the features of NPAL, Brightspace and NPGO, so that students would find their daily poly life easier. This means that our users do not have to juggle between so many tabs and potentially lag their devices or find doing assignments cumbersome, because EduHub incapsulates all integral features of Npal, Brightspace and NPGO. In addition to that, we also want students to have a platform for them to seek help if they run into issues while doing their assignment. Hence, EduHub also has a "Student Support" page where users can post their own queries and let other users answer.

To illustrate this, here are some user stories:

For example, a student that wants to keep track of his timetable and also revise learning materials at the same time does not have to open two seperate apps (NPGO and Brightspace) to do so. Instead, the student just has to make use of EduHub's timetable page and assignments page.

Another example, a student might be running into issues regarding the implementation of their API component while doing their Integrated Project. However, he does not have to worry as he can just go onto EduHub and post a question there in the "Student Support" page.

A student who has a low-end PC might cause lag to occur when too many tabs are open on their browser, such as Brightspace and NPal. However, with the introduction of EduHub, users do not have to worry about their browser lagging as all features of Brightspace and NPal are in the same website.
